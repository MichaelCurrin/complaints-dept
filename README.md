## About

Mostly based on code generated with [Claude AI](https://claude.ai). Using vanilla JS.

Prompt:

> Can you make a fun quirky website that is called Complaints Dept. And when you try and enter or submit a complain, it refuses because of one of 10 random excuses it shows.
> 
> The style should look like a 90s cheap website
